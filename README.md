# starWarsJava

# Description: This project is a grid-like Java game based on Star Wars. In the game, the World is a 2-dimensional grid 
with a character (Luke) that the player can control and various other non-playable characters and objects to interact with.

The code is stored in 2 folders: 
  The folder with monash prefix is codes developed by Monash University as the base of the game (base codes).
  The folder starwars contains codes developed by myself and my team mate that extended and implemented class from the base codes.
  Also, files with SW prefix (for example: SWActor) are also base codes.
  
# Installation: The project can be imported into any Java IDE (Netbean, Eclipse or IntelliJ). Optionally, the code can be examined 
using Bracket or Notepad+.
